<h3>Hello! I want to thank you for reviewing my CV. All this information is real and I can prove it documentary. I am a student now, although I can work in Your Company and Team. I am a self-developed developer and all my knowledge have got from documentation, learning sites and blogs. All time I am learning and finding new features and technologies. I practise my English and learn new words every day. In my free time, I like powerlifting, jogging and playing team kinds of sport such as football, volleyball, and cybersport matches.</h3>
